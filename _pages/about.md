I’m Zhiyu Cao. I’m cur­rently a post­doc­toral fel­low work­ing with Dr. Peter G. Wolynes at the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics (CTBP) of Rice University. My interests lie in developing statistical mechanics-based theories to study non-equilibrium processes in biology, chemistry, and physics, focusing on the latest advancements in polymer theory and soft condensed matter physics. A recent topic focuses on motorized-driven chromosome self-organization and dynamics, where motors consume ATP to drive the system out of equilibrium. Other areas of my research are the glass transition and the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of these mesoscopic systems.
